# The CoRonavIruS Health Impact Survey (CRISIS) â€“ Adapted for Autism and Related Neurodevelopmental conditions (AFAR)

This project aimed to answer two main questions: 1) Does the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health vary in youth with neurodevelopmental conditions, including autism spectrum or other neurodevelopmental conditions (NDD/ASD)?; 2) and what predicts risk and resilience in youth with autism and neurodevelopmental conditions? 


This repository includes the code used to run the main analyses for the CRISIS-AFAR paper. It is organized following the paper's analytical workflow. As listed below:

1)Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor analyses (FA)
2)Hierarchical Clustering analyses (HC)
3)Random Forest analyses (RF)


We also share a data dictionary including the the key variables used for these analyses to help in following the code.
